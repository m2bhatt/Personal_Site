    <div> About </div>
      <p> <h3> Writer </h3> Reading and writing have been my old companions since I was a kid. I have been in love with the
        English language ever since I learnt it along with Hindi. Long story short - I followed my passion
        and graduated as an English (Rhetoric and Professional Writing) Major at the University of Waterloo.
        Fun Fact - I have been writing poetry ever since I was 7. </p>

      <p> <h3> Front end developer </h3> I moved to Canada in grade 9 and there weren't many _computer_ courses offered in high schools
        in 2005-2008. I took a course that mentioned _web_ in its description, so I took it. I built my first web page and we watched
        Google's documentary (mention the name here). I was hooked. I got accepted into the University of Waterloo as aComputer Science
        major - yes, I was the only girl in my program.
        Fun Fact - Computer Science is mainly math and back end programming with 0 front end courses, so I switched 180 degrees. </p>

      <p> <h3> Baker </h3> During my university career, I was a Student Life Don and I started baking. The cookies filled lounge was enough to lure
        students in and build relationships. Sometimes I still use that trick to build relationships. Apparently, it's rude to say
        no to home baked goods, so that's how I make friends.
        Fun Fact - I once attempted selling my baked goods at Ottawa's farmer's market. or I sell my baked goods online. <p>

      <p><h3> Chocoholic </h3> Chocolates == Happiness. I could probably beat the record of eating the most chocolate
        bars in one sitting. </p>

      <p> I also enjoy random activities such as painting, hiking, running, working out, and learning new things. I work as an
        App Support Advocate at Shopify.
